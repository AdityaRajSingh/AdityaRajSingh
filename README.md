### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**Glad to see you here!** :star_struck: <br> The green dots on my [**GitHub** profile](https://github.com/AdityaRajSingh?tab=repositories) represent my journey :running_man: - From **being curious** :thinking: about how does [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/adi4adityaraj/) works back in 2009 to contributing my skills to different projects in various Hackathons and Internships. Outside of [GitHub](https://github.com/AdityaRajSingh/), find me  in the **basketball** :basketball: court! You can **find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaraj-singh/)**.
